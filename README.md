# Logic-Sampler

A pair of programs (for the moment) that enable a "cheap as chips" approach to implementing a logic analyser for I2C communications.

The two programs are a sketch for an Arduino Mega 2560 which performs capture of binary data and a companion Linux command line program
which performs post-processing to include a basic analysis of any I2C protocol identified.

## LogicSampler.ino

This basic script works in a simple manner:  It waits for input after which (on reciept) it proceeds to capture as much data from port K (all
8 bits) into memory.  Once the memory buffer is full it outputs a data an "ASCII Art" version of the data captured to allow a visual analysis
of the data caught.

At this point a futher capture and display cycle can be initiated with further input (notionally just pressing enter).

The output looks something like the following:
```
Digital Sampler
Keys:-
0-7     Select trigger pin
h       Trigger when pin goes high
l       Trigger when pin goes low
[CR]    Start sampling
```
The dynamic configuration works as follows:

* Press one digit '0' through '7' to select the pin for the trigger
* Press 'h' to trigger on a low->high transition
* Press 'l' to trigger on a high->low transition
* Press 'Enter' to start sampling
* Press any other key to disable the trigger

If you select a high trigger, and the line is already high it waits for the line to go low
before waiting for the low-high edge trigger.

If select a low trigger, the reverse applies. 

When a sample is triggered (or simple started) the output displays thus:
```

Futher down more interesting output would resemble this:

The above is an I2C Bus communication with the Clock on pin 6 and the Data on pin 5.

The three leading numbers are as follows:

* The sample index number 0 to 2999 (at the moment)
* The 'skipped sampes' between this sample and the previous sample (maximum 250) where the samples remained unchanged
* The raw digital value read from the input port (current port K)

At this level there is no analysis of the data.

For me, running under Linux, the best approach to using this sketch is to use minicom with the following command line:
```
minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -C samples.data
```
This provides the interaction with the Arduino required to start a sampling processs and
simultaeously captures the resulting data in a local file (sample.data) for further analysis.

How fast is this, what do the delta times really indicate?

The base clock frequency of the above I2C data is 100 KHz, a moderate speed for I2C.  Given
that (during I2C transmissions) the average delta value between samples is about 2 then this
indicates that the "loop code" is doing approximately 6 cycles for each whole cycle
of the I2C clock (we could say that it is sampling at about 600 KHz).  This is enough to be
reasonably confident that, at this clock speed, the I2C transmission is being accurately
observed and recorded.

## replay_i2c.c

This is a simple minded program reading from stdin writing to stdout, expecting the output from the Arduino Sketch
and appending to the end of lines any I2C related analysis it recognises.

The program takes two numerical arguments; the first is the bit number of the I2C clock, the second is the bit number
of the I2C data.

Thus, to analyse I2C data captured on pins 6 (clock) and 5 (data) I run the following
```
./replay_i2c 6 5 < ../samples.data | more
```
The program outputs the input sample data (as generated by the above sketch) and appends text for I2C actions.

Picking the same section of samples as above I get the following output:
